# CATSCENTRATION

## BACKGROUND
Game: Concentration

I chose to make the classic concentration/memory game but it is cat themed. Because I love cats, the player will be trying to find matching pairs of cats. When they find a pair, they'll be in for a little treat -- they'll hear an audio sound of my cat, Kiki, meowing, and the cards will stay flipped up. If a player can find all matching cards under the click count limit, then they will win. If a player cannot find all matching cards within the click count limit, then they lose. If they want to play again, they can click the "Play Again" button and give it another try! Each game, the cards will be shuffled.
